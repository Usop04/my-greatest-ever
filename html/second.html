    <h1>3) Near</h1>
      <img style="  float: left;  margin: 0 15px 0 0;" src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/05/0915f-16529837031559-1920.jpg" width="600px" height="450px">
      <h3 class="t"> Near is introduced to the story as a child at Wammy's House. He is first seen sitting alone in a room piecing together a white puzzle, with the puzzle's only design being a black letter 'L' in the corner. As some children run by the room, a young girl named Linda asks Near if he wants to play with them. Near replies, "No, thank you, Linda," and continues to put together his puzzle. Soon after, Roger Ruvie comes by the room with Mello and brings the two children to his office. There, Roger informs the two boys that L has died.</h3>
<h3 class="t">After the death of L, Near became his successor as well as the No. 1 detective. For Near, each and every investigation is a puzzle as he has a knack for solving complex problems. It has also been evident that Near has a pragmatic approach to life as an existentialist, which makes him more mature than L, Mello, and also Light.

    He was the one who suspected that the fake L could be the real Kira. It was also the efforts of L and Mello, which brought Near to a conclusion where he found out that Light Yagami was the Kira all along.</h3>
    <h1>2) L</h1>
    <img style="float: left; margin: 0 15px 0 0;" src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/05/e3dd9-16529837238199-1920.jpg" width="600px" height="450px">
    <h3 class="i">L is quite secretive, and only communicates with the world through his assistant, Watari. He never shows his face to the world in person, instead representing himself with a capital letter L drawn in "Old English MT" or "Cloister Black" typeface. It is more likely to be "Cloister Black" as Watari's "W" is different in "Old English MT."

        After meeting the Japanese Task Force, he requests that the task force refer to him as "Ryuzaki" as an additional safety measure. The Task Force never learns his true name, and it is revealed in neither the manga or anime.</h3>
        <h3 class="i">L is hailed as the world's greatest detective, whose identity remains a secret for his own safety. He is the only one who figured out that Kira lives in the Kanto region and is a high school student who wants to play Justice.

            Although no one knew the very existence of Death Note and Shinigami, L managed to join the pieces of the puzzle and successfully figured out the medium through which Kira was able to kill people. L totally believed his suspicions regarding Light Yagami. Moreover, if Light hadn't outplayed L with the help of Ryuk and Rem, the former would have got him in no time.</h3>
            <h1>1) Light Yagami</h1>
            <img style="float: right; margin: 0 15px 0 0;" src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/05/40ce4-16529837374960-1920.jpg" width="600px" height="450px">
            <h3 class="l">Light Yagami was just a high school student, but after laying his hands on the Death Note, he started developing a god complex. From creating a fake bottom in his desk to hiding the notebook to using a shinigami to make his bids, Light exceeded everyone’s expectations with his pure genius.

                It is not a child’s play to trick the world’s renowned detective like L that easily, but Light was the only individual who managed to do so. Light had backup for all of his plans and also used human subjects to act as Kira while he was under suspicion.
                
                Light Yagami is the most intelligent person in the series, as it took three exceptional detectives and an entire team behind it to figure out his real identity.</h3>
                <h3 class="l">Similar to his father Soichiro, Light has a strong sense of justice but this quickly becomes warped after he becomes tainted by the notebook’s power. Believing the world to be "rotten," he uses his Death Note as a means by which he can enact his will to rid the world of evil people. Light's main goal is to create a new world that is free of injustice and populated only with people whom he deems honest and kind, thus becoming the "God of the new world". Light is decisive and driven to achieve his ambitions, without faltering one bit in his beliefs. Despite knowing the criminality of murder, Light would consider his actions the ultimate “sacrifice” to help the</h3>
